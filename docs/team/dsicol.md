## Overview
MyLedger is a desktop app for managing finances, designed for university students studying locally or on exchange. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). For students that can type fast, MyLedger can help them record and monitor their budget and expenses, managing their transactions more effciently.

### Summary of Contributions
#### Main Features Implemented:

1. The expenditure package
   - **What it does** : Contains all the classes and operations for the fixed expenditure types and expenditure list. The classes are as follows: `AcademicExpenditure.java`, `AccomodationExpenditure.java`, `BorrowExpenditure.java`, `EntertainmentExpenditure.java` , `FoodExpenditure.java` , `LendExpenditure.java`, `OtherExpenditure.java`, `TransportExpenditure.java`, `TuitionExpenditure.java` and `ExpenditureList.java`.
   - **Justification**: The fixed expenditures in the program can be instantiated as real world expenditure, and kept track of in the application's expenditure list. Since the application aims to help users add and to manage expenditures, the package of classes forms the core of MyLedger.
   - **Highlights**: This feature sets the direction of MyLedger. Thus, deciding the attributes of each class played an important role in setting the trajectory of the application; brainstorming the important information the target user would need in their expenditure record.
